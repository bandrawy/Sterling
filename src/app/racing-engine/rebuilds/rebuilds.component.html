          Engine Rebuild Service
        </h5>
        <p class="lead">
          Sooner or later all engines eventually need to be rebuilt; unfortunately some engines sooner than others.  You’ve come to the right place to eliminate your troubles. Join the ranks of the savvy boaters who have had their engines rebuilt by the best in the business – Sterling Performance.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Some boaters went elsewhere to purchase engines having been led to believe they were getting a deal, only to find the engines they received either didn’t make the horsepower claim, or couldn’t do it reliably.  Don’t worry.  We totally understand.  Others may try to copy us, or mislead you with their claims, but there are no shortcuts to being the best, which is why we consistently set the standard by which all others are compared.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Discover why Sterling Performance engines reliably make their advertised horsepower and go the distance, and why more and more boaters are coming to us to rebuild their engines; done the right way.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          We happily rebuild all competitor engines, including Mercury, giving them our Sterling touch of excellence.
