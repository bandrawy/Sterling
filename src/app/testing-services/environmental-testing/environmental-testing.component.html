        Environmental Testing – Environmental Simulation – Climatic Testing
      </h5>
      <p class="lead">
        Many products and components have to operate long term in a variety of environments that Sterling Performance is able to simulate. Companies like yours are turning to us to help product development, eliminate warranty issues, and retain more customers with quality designed and tested products; ensured through quality environmental testing and climatic simulation.
        <br />
        At Sterling Performance you get the assurance your product can go the distance in the environment in which it will operate because we simulate a variety of environmental test conditions to meet your needs.
        <br />
        We have a variety of environmental test chambers that test, store, and validate your product’s performance in a variety of climatic conditions. We specialize in simulating real-world conditions; such as temperature, humidity, weather, salt spray corrosion, etc.
        <br />
        You can have us accelerate the aging process and simulate other extreme conditions to test the limits and durability of your products, materials, and components, and how they perform in different environments.
        <br />
        Besides extreme environmental conditions, and rapid cycling of temperature, pressure, and humidity, we can also hold these environmental conditions constant for extremely long periods of time (even ten years if you need) so your product can soak and be tested in these environments.
