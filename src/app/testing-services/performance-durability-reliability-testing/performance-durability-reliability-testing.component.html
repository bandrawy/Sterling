          Performance Testing
        </h5>
        <p class="lead">
          Performance Testing covers a broad range of testing, usually a product, part, material, or system’s ability to meet its design, engineering, or functional specifications and requirements, including any required environmental conditions in which the product, part, material, or system will be used.
        </p>
        <h5 class="featurette-heading">
          Durability Testing
        </h5>
        <p class="lead">
          Durability testing is the duration of time a product, part, material, or system can meet its performance requirements. e.g. lifetime span.  Durability testing is generally considered a subset of reliability testing.
