          Vibration Testing and NVH Testing

        </h5>

        <p class="lead">
          All products will experience vibration or shock at some time during normal use, shipping, or manufacturing. Years of wear and tear on products, components, and vehicle systems can be simulated in hours at Sterling Performance with our test equipment.
          <br />
          Sterling Performance offers a variety of environmental testing solutions for a large spectrum of qualification and reliability test needs. With three facilities and testing labs, we know testing.
          <br />
          We can perform testing in the areas of vibration, shock and acceleration to automotive, military, recreation, industrial, commercial, and aerospace specifications. This testing can be performed individually, or in combination with temperature cycling, pressure and hydraulic / pneumatic flow.

        </p>


        <h5 class="featurette-heading">
          Vibration Testing & Shock Testing:
        </h5>

        <p class="lead">
          Complete Vibration Test Lab offering compression testing, dynamics testing, drop test, and many other vibration shock testing services. List of typical items we can test.

        </p>
        <h5 class="featurette-heading">
          Combined Temperature & Vibration Testing:
        </h5>

        <p class="lead">
          Simultaneous Temperature and Vibration for Accelerated Evaluation. Combining the random vibration with thermal stressing can result in uncovering new failure modes.
        </p>
        <h5 class="featurette-heading">
          Environmental Stress Screening (ESS):
        </h5>

        <p class="lead">
          Fully Equipped ESS Test Lab for Vibration Testing, Thermal Cycling, Pressure Simulation and Climatic Exposure Testing.
        </p>
        <h5 class="featurette-heading">
          Test Analysis and Reports:
        </h5>

        <p class="lead">
          Once we have completed your vibration test, we can analyze the data and offer solutions to improve your product. We use powerful engineering analysis software to further study your vibration problems and reduce your stresses caused by vibration and shock.
        </p>
        <h5 class="featurette-heading">
          High Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) and High Accelerated Stress Screening (HASS):
        </h5>

        <p class="lead">
          We offer a wide range of environmental testing services including temperature, humidity, altitude, thermal vacuum, thermal shock testing, vibration testing, and corrosive atmosphere, as an example. If you are interested in High Accelerated Life Testing (HALT) and High Accelerated Stress Screening (HASS), please call us.

        <h5 class="featurette-heading">
          Resonance Investigations:
        </h5>

        <p class="lead">
          Our setup includes an electrodynamic shaker which is capable of performing “sine sweep” investigations, which is not possible in setups performing only repetitive shock.
        </p>
        <br />
        Sine sweeps are needed to identify each and every resonance in a system. That kind of resonance investigation is often needed to help lead to an understanding of why equipment failed and to determine a structural solution.
