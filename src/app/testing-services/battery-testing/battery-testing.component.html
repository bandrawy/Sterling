      If you are trying to develop long-lasting, high-quality batteries to meet the daily demands of your customers, we can help. Sterling Performance can conduct Battery Testing in real-life-situations and environmental conditions.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Heat for example can be a batteryâ€™s worst enemy for some types of batteries. We can conduct thermal shock testing, temperature extremes, and rapid temperature changes.
</p>
    <p class="lead">
      Battery Thermal Management in Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (EV & HEV) is essential for long service life and effective operation in all climates.  We can even help design, build, and test Battery Thermal Management Systems (BTMS); including prototype vehicles.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      We perform extensive battery testing services. We can test your batteries around-the-clock, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
